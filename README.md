## 🚀 Tech Stack

### Backend
* **Language:** Python 3.12
* **Framework:** Django & Django Rest Framework (DRF)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Async Tasks:** Celery + Redis
* **Documentation:** Swagger / OpenAPI (drf-spectacular)

### Frontend
* **Library:** React.js
* **Styling:** CSS Modules / Inline Styles (Custom Design)
* **HTTP Client:** Axios
* **Feedback:** React Hot Toast
* **UX Features:** Skeleton Loading, Debounced Search, Input Validation.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* **Complete CRUD:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete person records.
* **Admin Panel:** Built-in Django Admin to manage data with filters and search.
* **Advanced Filtering:** Filter by Date Range (Start/End) and Text Search.
* **Asynchronous Stats:** Calculate "Mean Age" and "Standard Deviation" using Celery background tasks (without blocking the UI).
* **Smart Validation:** Backend and Frontend validation (prevents invalid ages, checks required fields).
* **Data Seeding:** Custom script to generate mock data with historical dates for testing filters.
* **Dockerized:** Fully containerized environment (Web, DB, Redis, Worker).

## 🛠️ How to Run

### Prerequisites
* Docker & Docker Compose installed.

### 1. Clone and Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd example_crud_api

# Build and start containers (Detached mode)
docker compose up --build -d

```

### 2. Access the Application

* **Frontend:** [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000)
* **Backend API:** [http://localhost:8001](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:8001)
* **API Documentation (Swagger):** [http://localhost:8001/api/schema/swagger-ui/](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:8001/api/schema/swagger-ui/)

## 🔐 Admin Panel (Management)

The project includes a configured Django Admin panel to manage records directly.

### 1. Create a Superuser

Run this command in your terminal to create your login credentials:

```bash
docker compose exec web python3 manage.py createsuperuser

```

*(Follow the prompts to set a username and password)*

### 2. Access the Panel

Go to: **[http://localhost:8001/admin](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:8001/admin)**

> **Tip:** The Admin panel is customized to show filters by creation date, search by name, and display formatted hobbies.

## 🧪 Populating Database (Mock Data)

The project includes a script to generate realistic mock data with **past dates** (to test the date filtering feature).

Run the following command while the containers are running:

```bash
docker compose exec web python3 populate_db.py

```

> **Note:** This command connects to the running Django container and inserts 5 random records with varied creation dates (e.g., 2023, 2024).

If you want to **clear the database** before populating:

```bash
docker compose exec web python3 manage.py flush --no-input

```
